- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
It's important to learn classes over hooks since not everyone has adopted hooks.

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
Three life cycles are:
-componentDidMount which is the beginning phase of the component and render is invoked as well calling itself.
-componentDidUpdate is where setState is changed on the component's state data and forces it to render (growing/update phase.)
-componentWillUnmount removes the component off the screen and cleans up after.

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
Are hooks I build myself to be reusable that are applied for stateful logic.

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?
To check performance, write better code, to make sure the user has an experience they expect.
